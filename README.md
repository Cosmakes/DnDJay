# DnDJay
This is the official repository for the DnDJay, an open source soundboard/media player for TTRPGS/Boardgames. In the hopes that this project becomes useful to as many people as possible, I (the author), decided to license it under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/).
